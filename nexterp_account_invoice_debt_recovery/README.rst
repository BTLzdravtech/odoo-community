This module allows you set a invoice as "Debt Recovery". A setting is
available for each company in the Invocing Settings to allow/dissalow
the behaviour. A new tab will be available to write down debt recovery
terms. The payment state will be set as Debt Collector until the invoice
will be paid. The receivable line will be blocked for next follow-ups.
